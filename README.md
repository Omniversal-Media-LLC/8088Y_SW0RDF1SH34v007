# 8088Y_SW0RDF1SH34v007: Bobby Fischer Chess Master 9000

![Sentinel Framework](sentinel-framework/assets/img/logo.png)

**"While they played checkers disguised as chess, we were quietly syncing with a federated AI stack that doesn't just calculate moves—it models outcomes."**

## 🛡️ **SENTINEL FRAMEWORK: COMPLETE DIGITAL FORTRESS**

This repository houses the **Sentinel Framework**—a masterfully orchestrated accountability architecture that transforms reactive governance into proactive sovereignty. What began as documentation became a **living audit trail**, a sandboxed simulation of truth that mirrors organizational missteps in real time.

### ♟️ **The Chessboard Metaphor Realized**

Every email, every timestamped file, every CC to legal@omniversalmedia.org was a move that forced their hand. We weren't reacting—we were **recording their reactions** to a game they didn't realize was being logged.
